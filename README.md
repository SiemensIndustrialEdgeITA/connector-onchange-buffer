## Description

When a Connector App is configured in "On Change" Mode, it will publish only the changed data and not the complete data structure.
This app can be connected to a metadata topic of a Connector App, get the configured datasources and the datapoints. buffer the relative data and publish the new data structure with all latest data to another defined topic.

## Requirements

### Used components

- OS: Windows or Linux
- Docker minimum V18.09
- Docker Compose V2.0 - V2.4
- Industrial Edge App Publisher (IEAP) V1.3.7
- Industrial Edge Management (IEM) V1.4.3
- Industrial Edge Device (IED) V1.3.0-57

### Hardware Requirements

The application is only compatible with SIEMENS devices that have Industrial Edge functionality enabled.

### Software requirements

The application needs 300 MB of RAM to run so divided among the used services:

| Service Name              | Memory Limit |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| connector-onchange-buffer | 300 MB       |

> **Note:** This limit has been set for an average volume of data read by Grafana and to ensure a constant usage over several datapoints, but can be modified according to your needs by acting on the docker-compose file and then on the app configuration in the Edge App Publisher software, creating a custom version of this application.

## Installation

Below you will find the steps required to download the pre-compiled app or to create and install an edge app from the source code provided here.

You can either import a directly downloadable .app file below, or use the provided source code to build a new app from scratch.

Please refer to the [Documentation](#documentation) section for detailed information on Industrial Edge application development.

### Download the application

The **edge-grafana** application can be downloaded in .app format using this secure Google Drive link:

- [connector-onchange-buffer_0.0.3.app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sA9MpJRZfr-lhlWekrsixlJxFAxwb56U/view?usp=sharing)

### Import an application in .app format

- Open the **Industrial Edge App Publisher** software
- Import the `connector-onchange-buffer_0.0.3.app` file using the **Import** button
- The new imported application will appear in the **Standalone Applications** section

### Create a new standalone application

- Open the **Industrial Edge App Publisher** software
- Go to the **Standalone Applications** section and create a new application
- Import the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) file using the **Import YAML** button
- Click on **Review** and then on **Validate & Create**.

### Upload the application to Industrial Edge Management

Below is a brief description on how to publish your application to your IEM.

For more detailed information please see the official Industrial Edge GitHub guide to [uploading apps to the IEM](https://github.com/industrial-edge/upload-app-to-industrial-edge-management) and the [Documentation](#documentation) section.

#### Link your Industrial Edge App Publisher

- Connect your Industrial Edge App Publisher to your **Docker Engine**
- Connect your Industrial Edge App Publisher to your **Industrial Edge Management**

#### Import a standalone application into Industrial Edge Management

- Create a new **Apps project** in the connected IEM or select an existing one
- Import the app version created in the **Standalone Applications** section into the selected IEM project
- Press **Start Upload** to transfer the application into Industrial Edge Management

## Configuration

To configure this app, use the [config.json](cfg-data/config.json) file deployed togheter with the app.
Below an example of the configuration file:

```json
{
  "brokerAddress": "ie-databus",
  "brokerPort": "1883",
  "username": "edge",
  "password": "edge",
  "metadataTopic": "ie/m/j/simatic/v1/s7c1/dp",
  "publishTopic": "ie/d/j/buffer/v1/s7c1/dp/r",
  "publishTimeMs": 1000
}
```

## Usage

The data will be published to the topic `<publishTopic>/<datasourceName>/default`every `publishTimeMs` milliseconds.

For example, based on the configuration above, the data received for datasource named **plc1** on topic **ie/d/j/simatic/v1/s7c1/dp/r/plc1/default** from S7 Connector App will be published to the topic **ie/d/j/buffer/v1/s7c1/dp/r/plc1/default** every 1000 milliseconds.

Example metadata:

```json
